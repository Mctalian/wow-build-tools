	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// curseCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:

	curseCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&f.CurseId, "curseId", "p", "", "Set the CurseForge project ID for localization and uploading. (Use 0 to unset the TOC value)")

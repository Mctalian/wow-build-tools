This repository aims to be a collection of tools to help with the development of World of Warcraft addons. The main focus is on speed and ease of use, with the goal of making the development process as smooth as possible.

This should be considered a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.

## Features

I have many plans for this project, and I will communicate those plans at a later date.

### `BigWigsMods/packager` feature parity

To start, I'd like `wow-build-tools` to be as close to a drop-in replacement for `BigWigsMods/packager` as possible. That means, ideally, it should be able to handle all of the same features as `packager` with the same level of ease and speed or better.

## Inspiration and acknowledgements

My main inspiration comes from my desire to always make developer experience as smooth as possible. I've had a few different roles across different companies and industries that have focused on developer experience, and I've always found it to be a rewarding challenge and a force multiplier for teams. What better way to give back to the WoW community than to align my passions and expertise to help make the development process easier for addon authors?

I was also heavily inspired by [BigWigsMods/packager](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/packager) which provides (to my knowledge) the most widely used tool for packaging addons for distribution via CurseForge, WoWInterface, and Wago.io. Thank you to the authors and contributors of that project for all of their hard work and dedication!
